# Introduction to Air Quality & Community Sensing

## 🌫 Why Air Quality Matters  
PM2.5 and PM10 particles affect heart, lung, and cognitive health.  
Community-owned data empowers neighborhoods to:

- Detect pollution sources  
- Improve indoor air safety  
- Protect sensitive populations  
- Influence local policy

## 📡 How Our Clean Air Nodes Work  
Each node measures:

- PM1, PM2.5, PM10  
- Temperature + humidity  
- Optional VOCs  

Data is transmitted via WiFi to our dashboard.

## 🏫 Training Goals  
By the end of this training, community members can:

- Build and deploy their own sensors  
- Maintain purifiers and filters  
- Interpret local air-quality trends  
- Use the dashboard to detect events
