# Clean Air Project
A fully open-source community air monitoring and purification initiative designed to help neighborhoods — especially low-income and industrial-burdened areas — measure, understand, and improve their indoor and outdoor air quality.

---

# 🌱 Project Mission
To empower communities with:
- Low-cost open-source air sensors  
- Affordable DIY air purifiers  
- Data tools for environmental justice  
- Clean air education and local empowerment
