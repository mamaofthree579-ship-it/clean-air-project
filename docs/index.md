## 🌍 What is the Clean Air Project?

The **Clean Air Project** is an open-source initiative empowering communities to build, deploy, and share **low-cost air quality sensors**.  
Everything—from the hardware schematics to the firmware, cloud integration, and mobile dashboards—is open for anyone to use or contribute to.

We are creating a global network of **community air centers** that collect high-resolution particle, gas, temperature, and humidity data for public health, research, and citizen science.
