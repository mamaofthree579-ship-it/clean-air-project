🌎 Why This Project Exists

Industrial pollution, aging infrastructure, and lack of local monitoring leave many communities without access to real-time air-quality awareness.

The Clean Air Project empowers people to:

measure their air

understand pollution patterns

advocate for clean policies

protect vulnerable community members


All with open-source, low-cost hardware built from widely available components.
