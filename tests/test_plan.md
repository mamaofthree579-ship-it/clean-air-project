Test Plan — Clean Air Project

## 1. Hardware Tests

- ✔ PM sensor starts and initializes  
- ✔ Temperature & humidity readings stable  
- ✔ VOC baseline restoration works  
- ✔ Power stability tests (5V, battery, solar)  

## 2. Firmware Tests

- ✔ Wi-Fi/LoraWAN connectivity  
- ✔ JSON encoding  
- ✔ Local error logging  
- ✔ Auto-retry for transmission  

## 3. API Tests

- ✔ Authentication  
- ✔ Ingestion latency  
- ✔ Payload validation  

## 4. Environmental Validation

- ✔ Temperature drift measured  
- ✔ PM response in controlled smoke test
