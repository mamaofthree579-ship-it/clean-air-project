# Planting Plan — Clean Air Project

## Goals
- Increase canopy cover in targeted neighborhoods
- Reduce particulate matter and improve microclimate
- Engage community members in stewardship
- Collect data to evaluate air-quality impact

## Key steps
1. Site selection & permission (coordinate with landowners / local authorities)
2. Species selection (native, drought-tolerant, low VOC emissions)
3. Planting events (logistics, volunteers, tools, safety)
4. Maintenance (first 3 years most critical)
5. Monitoring (tree health + air sensor colocations)

## Roles
- Project lead: coordinates permissions, funding, reporting
- Site lead: local point-of-contact for each planting site
- Volunteer coordinator: recruitment, safety briefing, tools
- Monitoring lead: deploys sensors, collects data, generates reports

## Timeline (example)
- Month 0–1: site surveys & permissions
- Month 2: species selection and procurement
- Month 3–6: planting events (staggered)
- Year 1–3: maintenance & monitoring
