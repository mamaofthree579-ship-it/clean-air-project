# Site Selection Checklist

For each potential site, evaluate:

- Ownership & permission secured
- Underground utilities: locate 811 or local equivalent
- Soil type & drainage (well-drained preferred)
- Sun exposure (full sun/partial shade)
- Space for mature canopy (avoid under power lines)
- Proximity to roads/sidewalks (safety and visibility)
- Water access for early years
- Existing biodiversity (retain mature trees and shrubs where possible)
- Proximity to vulnerable population centers (schools, nursing homes)
- Opportunities to colocate air sensors (near tree canopy and reference points)

Scoring method:
- Score each criterion 0–3 (0 = unsuitable, 3 = ideal). Sites scoring 18+ recommended.
