# Recommended Tree Species (example — adapt to local ecoregion)

**Principles:** prioritize native species, canopy-forming, deep-rooting, drought tolerant, pollen-considerate.

**Example species (Temperate US — adjust per region)**

- *Quercus rubra* (Northern Red Oak) — large canopy, long lived
- *Acer saccharum* (Sugar Maple) — dense canopy, fall color
- *Gleditsia triacanthos* (Honey Locust - thornless varieties) — tolerant of urban soils
- *Tilia americana* (American Linden) — pollinator friendly, dense shade
- *Betula nigra* (River Birch) — good for wet soils along streams
- Native shrubs for understorey (Cornus sericea, Viburnum spp.)

**Avoid**:
- High VOC-emitting species (some eucalyptus and ornamental conifers)
- Strongly allergenic plants near schools if the community requests alternatives

**Planting size**:
- Use 1–2" caliper bare-root or containerized young trees for community events.
- Provide mulch rings, watering bags for first 2–3 years.

**Reference:** consult local Extension Service for region-specific natives.
