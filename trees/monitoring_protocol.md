# Monitoring Protocol — Trees & Air Impact

## Objectives
- Track tree survival & health
- Co-locate air sensors before/after planting to estimate localized impact
- Record environmental variables that affect interpretation (traffic, weather, events)

## Monitoring components
1. **Tree health log (visual)**  
   - ID, species, date planted, condition (healthy / stressed / dead), leaf cover %, canopy spread, notes, photos

2. **Air sensor colocations**  
   - Place air sensor(s) at 2 heights: ~1.5 m (breathing zone) and near canopy hub (to test filtration effect)
   - Baseline: collect at least 2 weeks of pre-planting data
   - Post-plant: continuous monitoring for 12+ months; compare matched time-of-day windows

3. **Metadata & contextual data**  
   - Weather (temp, humidity, wind) — use nearest weather station or on-site BME sensor
   - Nearby construction, roadworks, or fires to flag anomalies
   - Presence of mowing or vegetation disturbance that can affect PM readings

## Data frequency
- Air sensors: 1–5 minute sampling ideal; 15 min minimum
- Tree health: monthly for first year, quarterly after
- Photos: take from fixed vantage points after planting, then quarterly

## Data quality & QA
- Co-locate a reference-grade instrument for at least 48–72 hours to calibrate low-cost sensors
- Apply humidity correction if sensor requires it
- Remove outliers caused by maintenance events (e.g., immediate dust from planting)
